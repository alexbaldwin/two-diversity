<div><p>Location: San Francisco, CA or Remote</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>Our product infrastructure team is looking for a data engineer to reform the Wikimedia Foundation’s approach to data instrumentation, so that we can continuously learn how to make Wikipedia and its sister projects more useful. This is a great position for you if you love instrumenting the full stack and cherish the opportunity to help software engineers, data scientists, and product managers through better data engineering tools and techniques. You will play an important role in improving our data insight capabilities, nurturing an even more data informed culture in our products and programs.</p>
<p>You will have the opportunity to work with software that serves&nbsp;over half a billion pages per day&nbsp;through Wikipedia (and other Wikimedia sites), build components that operate in a privacy first manner, and modernize code and practices that support experimentation, measurement, monitoring &amp; alerting, and reporting in our product department.</p>
<p>Are you ready to write open source software that operates on data at the scale and speed of Wikipedia traffic, innovate in applied data science that respects user privacy, and help create&nbsp;a world in which everyone can freely share in the sum of all knowledge?</p>

We host the Wikimedia projects, build software experiences for reading, contributing, and sharing Wikimedia content, support the volunteer communities and partners who make Wikimedia possible, and advocate for policies that enable Wikimedia and free knowledge to thrive. The Wikimedia Foundation is a charitable, not-for-profit organization that relies on donations. We receive financial support from millions of individuals around the world, with an average donation of about $15. We also receive donations through institutional grants and gifts.
